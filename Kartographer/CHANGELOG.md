# 0.1.0.1
Apoapsis, Periapsis, Ascending/Descending Node, Atmosphere Entry/Exit buttons added to time control (shared by maneuver editor and warp to).
Sorting by name added to vessel select.
Made the time between exploding parts for "Unleash the Kraken" random.
Moved orbit buttons on Warp To so they are consistent with maneuver editor.

Bug Fixes:
Fixed persistence of the kraken warning, so it really is shown only once.
Refresh the vessel list when a vessel is destroyed.
